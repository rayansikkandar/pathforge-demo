# ReAct Loop Demo - Intentional dependency conflicts
# This scenario is designed to showcase PatchForge's multi-package update capability

# Flask ecosystem with known vulnerabilities
Flask==2.0.1          # CVE-2023-30861 (CVSS: 9.8) - Will upgrade to 2.3.3
                       # INTENTIONAL: Flask 2.3.3 requires Werkzeug>=2.2.2 and MarkupSafe>=2.1.1
Werkzeug==2.0.0       # CVE-2023-25577 (CVSS: 7.5) - TOO OLD for Flask 2.3.3
                       # This will trigger coordinated upgrade in ReAct loop

# INTENTIONAL CONFLICT: MarkupSafe is too old for Flask 2.3.3+
MarkupSafe==2.0.0     # Flask 2.3.3 requires MarkupSafe>=2.1.1
                       # This will cause a conflict that triggers multi-package update

# Jinja2 also has dependencies on MarkupSafe
Jinja2==3.0.0         # Should be compatible, but may need update

# Other vulnerable packages
requests==2.25.1      # CVE-2023-32681 (CVSS: 6.1)
urllib3==1.26.5       # CVE-2023-43804 (CVSS: 5.9)  # CVE-2023-43804 (CVSS: 5.9)

# PyYAML for serialization vulnerabilities
PyYAML==5.3.1         # CVE-2020-14343 (CVSS: 9.8)

# Testing
pytest>=7.0.0

# DEMO EXPECTATION:
# Attempt 1: Upgrade Flask 2.0.1 → 2.3.3 → FAIL (Werkzeug 2.0.0 incompatible)
# Attempt 2: Nemotron refines → Upgrades Flask + Werkzeug + MarkupSafe → PASS ✓
